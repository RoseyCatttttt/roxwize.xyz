Hi, this is <span class="t3t3">roxwize</span>. I am a [purple-ish cat-rabbit](me.html) who sucks ass at programming. I love everything and everything loves me back.

This website is under construction. I know most websites on Neocities say that but I really mean it this time.
Most stuff hasn't been fully realized yet. I'll let you know when it's all finished. If you're coming here from the old website, welcome. Take a seat and grab some coffee. Don't, actually, I don't have any because I hate coffee. Have some water instead. I intend to make this website much more relaxed and straightforward than my previous iterations. There's no directory to older versions because there are none. There's no 300Mb needlessly being used. It's just you. And I. Source code for the build system is [here](https://github.com/thekifake/roxwize.xyz/blob/master/uproot.js) if you want to look over it, suggestions for improvements are appreciated.

This place serves as a repository to store that which piques my interest. Expect me to inject my ramblings into here regularly, as well as put stuff that I've made for you to use/interact with. You can talk to/yell at me on [my Neocities profile](https://neocities.org/site/hoylecake).
