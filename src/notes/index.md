If I have something on my mind, but I don't feel like writing an entire 10+ paragraphs about it, it goes here. Posts are (will be) [POSSE](https://indieweb.org/POSSE/)'d elsewhere using  [Bridgy](https://brid.gy/) (eventually). Unfortunately, because Neocities is a website host and not, actually, a self-hosting service, I can not use the method of having my own website URL as my Fediverse tag. Which would be fucking badass! But alas.
