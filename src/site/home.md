Hi, this is <span class="t3t3">roxwize</span>. I am a [purple-ish cat-rabbit](me.html) who sucks ass at programming. I love everything and everything loves me back.

This place serves as a repository to store that which piques my interest. Expect me to inject my ramblings into here regularly, as well as put stuff that I've made for you to use/interact with. You can talk to/yell at me on [my Neocities profile](https://neocities.org/site/hoylecake). The source code for the website is on GitHub at [thekifake/roxwize.xyz](https://github.com/thekifake/roxwize.xyz)... but it'll probably get moved to Sourcehut at one point or another.
