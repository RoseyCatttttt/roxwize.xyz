This is where I log the music that I've listened to.

**In concerns to the old X/7 rating system:** the rating scale is not necessarily linear, it's more-so logarithmic. I rarely ever give stuff low ratings so a 5 is usually an 8.5 or a 9 on a /10 rating scale. A 7 is the highest honor to be bestowed upon a release. Stuff on the same level as LP5 or Kid A. It's my favorite number, naturally. 5 is a B+, this is really great; 6 is an A, this is fucking fantastic; 7 is an A+, one of my all time favorites probably.

I don't use the 7 max anymore because it's weird and confusing and I only used 7 because 7 is my lucky number.
