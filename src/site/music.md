This is where I log the music that I've listened to. The rating scale is not necessarily linear, it's more-so logarithmic. I rarely ever give stuff low ratings so a 5 is usually an 8.5 or a 9 on a /10 rating scale. A 7 is the highest honor to be bestowed upon a release. Stuff on the same level as LP5 or Kid A. It's my favorite number, naturally. 5 is a B+, this is really great; 6 is an A, this is fucking fantastic; 7 is an A+, one of my all time favorites probably.
