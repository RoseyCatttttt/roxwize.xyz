Have a seat. There is milk in the fridge. Let me tell you about myself.

I am a guy, I live in the United States. My main interests are [programming](#programming), [music](#music), and [art](#art). Very broad interests, yes, but with how frequently I change hobbies it's really all I have to cling onto at this point. My favorite pet is cat. mi ken toki lili e toki pona.

I intend to populate this area with my interests and stuff over time. Expect a lot of moving parts and spring cleaning.

### Programming

My favorite programming language is [Uiua](https://www.uiua.org/), second favorite is [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/). I primarily write JavaScript. GitHub account is at [https://github.com/thekifake/](https://github.com/thekifake/).

### Music

I primarily listen to [IDM/braindance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_dance_music), [alt rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_rock), and [ambient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambient_music). My favorite artists are [Autechre](https://www.last.fm/user/thekillective/library/music/Autechre), [Radiohead](https://www.last.fm/user/thekillective/library/music/Radiohead), and [Bon Iver](https://www.last.fm/user/thekillective/library/music/Bon+Iver). I also occasionally dip into music creation of my own. No specific details yet, but my Soundcloud is at [https://soundcloud.com/thekifake/](https://soundcloud.com/thekifake/).

### Art

I draw, sometimes. You've seen my art before, most likely. It's fun and I intend to go further with it but I also find comfort in graphic design. Not of the serious kind. Of the very amateurish and naive kind. Most of my art, including music, is inspired by the minimalism of [The Designers Republic](https://www.thedesignersrepublic.com/). I often times will take things I find in random parts of the Internet and make them their own thing. This is usually entirely by happenstance.

### Games

Games are cool. Fun. I like chess but it gives me a lot of stress and anxiety so I rarely play it. Blackjack is a lot of fun, so is Texas Hold'Em. If you're not actually losing money by playing it. I would not know, I've never been to a casino before.

Portal 2 is probably one of my favorite video games next to OneShot and Yume 2kki. If I had to rank them, Yume 2kki would be on the top. It's a good game. I like it.

### Religion

I'm mostly agnostic. That's as much as I'm willing to discuss.

### What else?

If you have any burning questions about me, please feel free to [email me](mailto:biscordbro@gmail.com). I will put the answers up on this page and your question will be memorialized Forever.
