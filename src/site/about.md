This used to be a rather grand page. Can't be arsed to give this page as much maintenance as it warrants so I'm stripping it down.

I'm roxwize. I am a guy, I live in the United States. I write code and compose music. Sometimes I draw too. I'm so relatively badass that my website is unblocked everywhere under the grounds that it is most definitely IT-related.

Minimalism is my life. The Designers Republic makes the only modern art I can stand to look at. [My taste in music](#rh-music) is similarly pretentious.

If you have any burning questions, please feel free to [email me](mailto:biscordbro@gmail.com).

### Music

I primarily listen to [IDM/braindance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_dance_music), [alt rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_rock), and [ambient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambient_music). My favorite artists are [Autechre](https://www.last.fm/user/thekillective/library/music/Autechre), [Radiohead](https://www.last.fm/user/thekillective/library/music/Radiohead), and [Bon Iver](https://www.last.fm/user/thekillective/library/music/Bon+Iver).

### Games

Games are cool. Fun. I like chess but it fucks me over so I rarely play it. Blackjack is a lot of fun, so is Texas Hold'Em. If you're not actually losing money by playing it. I would not know, I've never been to a casino before.

Portal 2 is probably one of my favorite video games next to OneShot and Yume 2kki. If I had to rank them, Yume 2kki would be on the top. It's a good game. I like it.
