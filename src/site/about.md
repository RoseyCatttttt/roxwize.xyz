  summary: Wow!

Have a seat. There is milk in the fridge. Let me tell you about myself.

I am a guy, I live in the United States. My main interests are [programming](#programming), [music](#music), and [art](#art). Very broad interests, yes, but with how frequently I change hobbies it's really all I have to cling onto at this point.

I intend to populate this area with my interests and stuff over time. Expect a lot of moving parts and spring cleaning.

### Programming

My favorite programming language is [Uiua](https://www.uiua.org/), second favorite is [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/). I primarily write JavaScript. GitHub account is at [https://github.com/thekifake/](https://github.com/thekifake/).

### Music

I primarily listen to [IDM/braindance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_dance_music), [alt rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_rock), and [ambient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambient_music). My favorite artists are [Autechre](https://www.last.fm/user/thekillective/library/music/Autechre), [Radiohead](https://www.last.fm/user/thekillective/library/music/Radiohead), and [Bon Iver](https://www.last.fm/user/thekillective/library/music/Bon+Iver). I also occasionally dip into music creation of my own. No specific details yet, but my Soundcloud is at [https://soundcloud.com/thekifake/](https://soundcloud.com/thekifake/).

### Art

I draw, sometimes. You've seen my art before, most likely. It's fun and I intend to go further with it but I also find comfort in graphic design. Not of the serious kind. Of the very amateurish and naive kind. Most of my art, including music, is inspired by the minimalism of [The Designers Republic](https://www.thedesignersrepublic.com/). I often times will take things I find in random parts of the Internet and make them their own thing. This is usually entirely by happenstance.
