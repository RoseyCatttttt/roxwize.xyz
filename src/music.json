    "description": "A very dark and noisy companion LP to Exai that offers the same bombastic-as-shit first impression as Gantz Graf while being as inaccessible as Untilted. tac Lacora has become one of my favorite tracks from them with how frantic and all-over-the-place it is. It closes on newbound, which sounds a lot more friendly.",
