    "description": "I'm having a difficult time writing this without tripping over my own words, so I'll try to be brief.<br><br>I don't think any album has captivated me and made me as emotional as Today I Laid Down did. It's been ages since I've been this touched by an album to the point of tears. It's such a sentimental and cozy album, one that never tries to bore you but one that never tries to overwhelm you either. It feels grand and unwavering. It sounds reserved and passionate at the same time. It's an ethereal experience.<br><br>Kai was incredibly talented. I admire his talent and drive to have pursued his passions to such a degree. Life is really awful sometimes... and this is a grim reminder of that. But in spite of that, it still instills hope in myself, the motivation to keep persisting... Rest easy, Kai. You are loved.",

    "rating": "5.5",
    "favoriteTrack": "r cazt",
    "description": "SIGN is solely ambient in many ways, minus a few exceptions; it's, as far as I can tell, the most \"ambient\" thing they've put out since Tri Repetae (take this with a grain of salt). They dabbled in it for a bit. Perlence losid 2 off of Quaristice.Quadrange.ep.ae is one of my favorite purely ambient songs they've made, and all end off of NTS Session 4 is probably my no.1 favorite ambient track of all time. These guys are great at doing this stuff; it's Max/MSP and some extra soft/hardware, since Confield it's been in their blood to do generative music after having dabbled with it in the late 90s. Ambient and generative go hand in hand, there's a reason you can't go anywhere on Patchstorage or what have you without seeing something marketing itself as that. SIGN goes a lot further in its execution of this style and texture of music, though. While many of the tracks on here are some of the most beautiful they've ever put out, this album also contains some of the most bland and boring-sounding music they've produced. Towards the beginning, it creates a fantastic first impression. M4 Lema is surreal & sublime bathhouse music, followed by F7, which gives off an odd sense of deja vu, and gives off a feeling of triangles and distortion... esc desc sort of reminds me of O=0 from Oversteps, but on a much grander scale, starting meaningful and subdued, ultimately growing to become chaotic and larger-than-life. Metaz form8 doesn't need an explanation; it's <em>fucking beautiful</em>, in a way that's difficult to describe. It feels emotional, solemn, and melancholy, but hopeful and optimistic, too, in its own way. Synths sound like they're being torn apart to orchestrate a perfectly-formed harmony of tattered digital strings. sch.mefd 2 marks a return to the earlier au14-type jam stuff, but it's still wholly simple and textural in nature. There are a lot of minor subtleties here, as with most other tracks, and the entire composition evolves slowly over time, revealing many background instruments that are further revealed on repeated listen. Even one of the lows of this album is still structurally very well put together. The three songs that follow, though, are... they feel like outtakes. I wouldn't mind if the album didn't have these at all. They don't seem to evolve as much, focusing on maybe three or more notes played on the same synthesizer as background elements come and go. gr4 is the best out of all of these, but even then, it feels a bit bland compared to the rest of the good tracks. The others did this sort of generative simplicity well because the melodies they created, although likely random, felt impactful in some way. It felt like the work behind getting them to make the notes they made was entirely intentional, crafted from passion rather than from a need to make a synth voice spit out notes. After these songs are over, though, is when r cazt plays. A perfect closer to a a shockingly poignant album. The highs and lows of the 11-track landscape, fluctuating between mournful and incandescent soundscapes and impactful and strong beats, culminate in an almost depressing orchestra of synthesized horns working in unison. Their playing is almost cacophonous, yet it still manages to further the harmony that other synth voices provide, sounding of longing, as if something is lost. Their accompanying instruments work in tandem to lift each other up, becoming slightly hopeful, and ominous all the same. The deep bass adds a sense of foreboding, while the high-pitched crystallized synth contributes to a sense of beauty and of appreciation. It feels final. It feels like an end to something. Like a thousand dying computers singing in harmony as their power fizzles out and they pass, never to be heard from again. Bordering on the edge of the universe, trying to find meaning. And then it ends.<br><br>If you're Japanese or something, you get n Cur, which feels like a new beginning; as if r cazt was the end of existence, a last cry from every soul on Earth as their essence is stripped away from them and lost forever, and this song is the new beginning that takes place immediately after. What remains of the universe now explodes to create a million more beatiful spectacles of light and sound. Reality flourishes for a brief two minutes, perhaps experiencing the beauty of destruction or of rebirth, holding on to something beyond as a last hope for its survival, or as a possibility for the future, before it sizzles out yet again. But this time it's not abrupt, it's a slow fade out. The arpeggiated lead synthesizer and the fluctuating melody subdued in the background join hands and dance around each other until they cease to be. SIGN is, in many ways, a beautiful display of Autechre's ability to create stunning ambience, while also in many ways a display of some of their greatest faults. But in the parts where it truly shines, it is some of their best in years.",

If the suns were possessed by some Thom Yorke entity hot off the tails of three extremely popular singles who like Dan Treacy and Brian Eno to the point where they want to pay tribute to them in the best way possible, who could just fucking MAKE a 12-minute contemporary Bohemian Rhapsody, ehmmm... they would give this to the world. The suns would produce this emotional, mindfuck rollercoaster of an album and HURL it DIRECTLY INTO FLORIDA, everyone would HATE IT UNTIL THEY GOT OVER THEMSELVES, ROXWIZE WOULD LOVE IT, EVERYONE WOULD LOVE IT.

    "addendum": "I know I went crazy over this album. I still am, but most of the craziness has mostly worn off. I am not much of a psychedelic rock guy. Is that what this is? I feel like that's what this is. I had heard MGMT before, duh, Kids was the shit and it scared the fuck out of me as a kid and Time To Pretend is just fucking awesome. Both of their three main hits have at least some kind of nostalgia associated with them. But, personally? I find the songs on this album to be far better than those hits. I'm not saying this to be a contrarian, no, no, it's my honest opinion. Flash Delirium elicits the greatest feeling of musical ecstasy I have felt since the very first time I listened to Acroyear2. The ending really sounds like The Killers. Which is great because I LOVE The Killers. The music video is real funny. Siberian Breaks is also a favorite of mine (although not quite as good as Flash Delirium ...), it's what introduced me to this album in the first place. I'd say it deserves its status as the most popular song off the album, as it is just fucking fantastic on its own. One of my favorite parts of MGMT is how they intentionally obscure the meanings of their songs. It's fun to try to fruitlessly figure it out. I don't <em>like</em> when the artist of a song just releases it and says \"oh, yeah, this song is about FUCKING HOOKERS and shit\". It ruins the magic of just trying to figure it all out. Like those pictures on the screen. It's Working has a fantastic outro that makes my face look like this ----> :) for a bit, and Song For Dan Treacy is just... fun, really fun. I don't even know that guy. Is Dan Treacy cool? I know Brian Eno. Should I know Dan Treacy? Lady Dada's Nightmare sounds straight off of Dead Cities, Read Seas, & Lost Ghosts by MGMT and I love that album! And Brian Eno, too!<br/><br/>This <em>entire</em> thing reminds me of <a href=\"https://poignant.guide\">Why's (Poignant) Guide To Ruby</a> for some fucked up reason. I don't know what that reason is. But I love this album infinitely more because of that. Maybe it's because I was doing my bi-monthly rereading of that book as I was also binging this album? Perhaps? There was also a soundtrack they made for that book, it's not TOO dissimilar from this, I haven't listened to that much, though... I might give that a review. Yes, yes! Yes."

    "description": "Large, spacious, and various, this album never chooses to settle on one place for too long.

It isn't perfect, and it has some minor annoyances throughout, but it's a damn good ambient album nonetheless.",

    "favoriteTrack": "RENIFORM PULS",
    "description": "A foreboding and futuristic-sounding work that is as ominous as it is strangely nostalgic. This album contains some of the most striking song titles I've seen on an Autechre release, and the songs are just as heavy-hitting, fluctuating between quaint, subtle optimism in the first half of IV VV IV VV VIII, and unabashed percussion-centric mayhem in XYLIN ROOM and V-PROC. This album gives me the strongest sense of deja vu, and I've become very attached to it for how charming the songs are, despite their perceived coldness and inhumanity. It's like the playfulness of Quaristice mixed with the bleakness of Confield.",
