I used to be really keen on making a blog. I wanted to do what all the other people were doing. Writing about things that were useful, to others. That I found useful when I was perusing the Internet. I wanted to contribute. I have given up.

I don't intend to sell you a product, or give some useful programming anecdote. This is where I sit down for an hour or two and write about myself. Indulge.

Post titles are [Arvelie dates](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/arvelie.html). The contents of the posts themselves are usually not proofread.
