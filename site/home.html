I am a <a href="me.html">purple-ish cat-rabbit</a> who sucks ass at programming. I love everything and everything loves me back.</p>
<p>This website is under construction. I know most websites on Neocities say that but I really mean it this time.
Most stuff hasn&#39;t been fully realized yet. I&#39;ll let you know when it&#39;s all finished. Right now I&#39;m working on getting the build system working. It uses a contrived method for reading Markdown files and putting them elsewhere. It&#39;s entirely bespoke, and it&#39;s not pretty <em>at all</em>, but it doesn&#39;t take forever and it fits the purposes of what I want it to be; that is, it builds pages in a way that fits the needs of this website, and it won&#39;t flood people&#39;s Neocities feeds with a thousand page updates.</p>
<p>If you&#39;re coming here from the old website, welcome. Take a seat and grab some coffee. Don&#39;t, actually, I don&#39;t have any because I hate coffee. Have some water instead. I intend to make this website much more relaxed and straightforward than my previous iterations. There&#39;s no directory to older versions because there are none. There&#39;s no 300Mb needlessly being used. It&#39;s just you. And I.</p>
<p>Nothing is obfuscated. If you know where to look, you&#39;ll find what you&#39;re looking for. Source code for the build system is <a href="https://github.com/thekifake/roxwize.xyz/blob/master/uproot.js">here</a> if you want to look over it, suggestions for improvements are appreciated.</p>
<p>This place serves as a repository to store that which piques my interest. Expect me to inject my ramblings into here regularly, as well as put stuff that I&#39;ve made for you to use/interact with. You can talk to/yell at me on <a href="https://neocities.org/site/hoylecake">my Neocities profile</a>.</p>
